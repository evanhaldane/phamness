to-do list:

✓ cumulative? answer: not a good visualization for future years
✓ compare last few years
✓ don't modify master player objects - may need to be re-used
✓ filter out pitchers and/or include pitcher war
✓ in autocomplete only include players who played last year

✓ war / 600?
✓ bayesian estimate of war/600? - v2
✓ same position? - Not easily doable, ignore for now
- only include in filter if has future to compare

- once decisions are made on all/most of above, make pretty
- transitions on scales
- tooltips on points?
